# Bookmarks YoutubeDL

This script downloads all videos from a bookmarks folder. For now, it only handles Google Chrome bookmarks. By default, it downloads videos from the "Musics" bookmarks folder. It requires the bookmarks JSON file as input to retrieve urls and download videos.

The download part is done using YouTube-DL. (https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#embedding-youtube-dl)
